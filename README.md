# Lotto

Lottery application I am currently working on for educational purposes.

It is being developed using the Test Driven Development process. It is based on a modular architecture. I used the JUnit library to create unit tests and Spring MockMVC for integration tests. 
I used the non-relational database MongoDB. For communication over HTTP, I built a REST API in Spring Boot. The application and database are hosted using docker images .

# Lotto

Lottery application I am currently working on for educational purposes.

It is being developed using the Test Driven Development
process. Is based on a modular architecture. I used the JUnit
library to create the tests. For database communication I would
like to use the Hibernate framework and for communication
over HTTP I would like to build a REST API in Spring Boot.
